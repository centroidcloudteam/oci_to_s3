This OCI Function will upload files to S3 bucket. This function can be invoked by service connector hub to send audit, monitoring or logs to S3 bucket for consumption by third party systems like SIEM tools rapid7. Note that even though OCI buckets are S3 compatible however tools sometime do not give option to change the bucket endpoint to point to OCI bucket endpoints. Hence need for this function.
